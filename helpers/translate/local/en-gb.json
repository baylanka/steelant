    "paragraph_01": "SteelWall ISH designs, develops, produces and sells interlocking systems (connector bars) to connect steel structures such as steel pipes (pipe-pilings), heavy steel profiles (H sheet-piles), and steel sheets with fixed clutch bars (sheet piles) to build continuous, interconnected and extremely stable steel-support and steel-retention walls, commonly referred to as sheet-pile walls.",
    "paragraph_02": "Over the last one hundred years, sheet-pile walls have seen their use skyrocket in applications such as excavation retention, bridge sites, quays, docks, water-lock walls, channels, flood protection, tunnels, underground parking garages, hazardous material leakage prevention, among many other applications.",
    "paragraph_03": "SteelWall connectors are third-generation technology that are manufactured at certified mills of the highest quality and precision. From an engineering, design, and ease-of-use standpoint they are a technologically superior product, extremely strong, easy to drive and are simply unbeatable from an economic efficiency point of view.",
    "paragraph_04": "Explore this website and contact a SteelWall representative to learn why SteelWall connectors are one of the fastest growing construction industry products world-wide."
